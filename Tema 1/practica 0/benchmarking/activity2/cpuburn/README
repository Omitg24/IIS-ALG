cpuburn lets you use 100% of all available cores, useful when stress-testing.

== Installation

Download cpuburn from http://patrickmylund.com/projects/cpuburn/

If you have Go installed, you can run: go get github.com/pmylund/cpuburn
(a cpuburn binary will be added to your GOPATH/bin folder)

Note: You do not need to have Go installed to run the stand-alone version.

== Usage

  ./cpuburn (burn all available cores)
  ./cpuburn -n 2 (burn two cores)
  ./cpuburn -n 4 -u 5 (burn four cores, updating every five seconds)
